# asteroid-renderer

A prelude to some sort of game I guess

## TODO

- a Face class to hold colour and normal vector alongside points
    - backface culling based on normals
- sort out collisions (they get stuck together, need moving apart)
- screen coords -> game coords (click/tap handling)
- better scaling for mobile
